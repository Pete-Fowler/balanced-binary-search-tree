# Summary

This was a student project from 2022. This repository contains Node and Tree classes to create and explore a balanced binary search tree.

# Methods

The Tree methods will build a tree, search the tree for a value, insert a value, and delete a value. There are also methods to traverse the tree and execute a callback on the node for inorder, level order, preorder, and postorder traversals, and methods to test if the tree is balanced and to rebalance the tree if it is not.
